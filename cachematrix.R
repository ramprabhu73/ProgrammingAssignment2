## The file has 2 functions, the objective of the code is to make an inverse of a matrix
## and return the solve() of it. If the inverse is already computed and in cache, it will
## return the object in cache else it is recalculate it and output the value

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
